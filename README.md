# Haeckel/php-exception

Haeckel/php-exception is a php library that provides utilities and extensions for exceptions.

## Features

- [Utilities](src/Util) to make working with exceptions easier:
    - [MessageProvider](src/Util/MsgProvider.php): Provide common exception message templates to
    have consistent exception messages.

- Extensions:

    the exception is thrown. This context can then be passed to a psr/log compatible logger.
